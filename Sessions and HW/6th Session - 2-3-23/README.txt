Global variable psh log
Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in the program, 
regardless of the location of the code that wants to use them. 
In other words, a global variable has a scope that extends throughout the entire program, 
allowing it to be used by functions and code blocks defined in different parts of the program.
In most programming languages, global variables are declared outside of any function, 
and they can be accessed and modified by any function or code block in the program. 
The use of global variables can make it easier to share data between different parts of a program, 
but they can also make it more difficult to understand the behavior of the program, 
and they can lead to unintended side effects if they are not used carefully.
It's generally considered a best practice to avoid using global variables whenever possible, 
and to instead use local variables that have a more limited scope. When global variables are necessary, 
it's important to document their use and behavior clearly, to minimize the risk of unintended consequences.
